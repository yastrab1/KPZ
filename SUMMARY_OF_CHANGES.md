# Summary of Changes

## Renaming apt.py to kpz.py

As requested, I've renamed the `apt.py` script to `kpz.py` and updated all references to it in the codebase. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Created a new file `front/kpz.py` based on the existing `front/apt.py` file
2. Updated the description in the ArgumentParser to use "KPZ Package manager" instead of just "Package manager"
3. Updated the README.md file to replace all occurrences of "apt.py" with "kpz.py"
4. Updated the SUMMARY.md file to replace all occurrences of "apt.py" with "kpz.py" and "apt-like" with "KPZ"
5. Created a new file `front/test_kpz.py` based on the existing `front/test_apt.py` file, with all references to "apt.py" replaced with "kpz.py"
6. Created a copy of the `kpz.py` script in the `back/pkgs` directory so it can be compiled using the existing `compile.py` script

## Compilation

I attempted to compile the script using the existing `compile.py` script, but encountered issues with creating a virtual environment. The error message suggests installing the python3.12-venv package, which is likely beyond the scope of what we can do in this environment.

In a real environment, you would need to:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   sudo apt install python3.12-venv
   ```

2. Run the compile.py script:
   ```
   cd back
   python3 compile.py
   ```

This would compile the `kpz.py` script into an executable and place it in the `back/dist` directory. The executable would be named `kpz.exe`.

## Testing

After compilation, you would need to test the compiled executable to verify that it works as expected. You can use the `test_kpz.py` script for this purpose:

```
cd front
python3 test_kpz.py
```

This would test all the commands (update, list, install, remove, upgrade) and verify that packages are correctly installed and removed.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the compilation of the `kpz.py` script into an executable
2. Test the compiled executable to verify that it works as expected
3. Update any other references to "apt" in the codebase that may have been missed
4. Consider updating the original `apt.py` file to be a wrapper around `kpz.py` for backward compatibility
